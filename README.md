# CRUD in PHP: Create, Read, Update, Delete
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four basic operations for managing data in a database. This tutorial will guide you through implementing a basic CRUD application using PHP and MySQL.
# We’ll cover:

Create – Adding new records.
Read – Viewing existing records.
Update – Modifying existing records.
Delete – Removing records.

We'll use PHP to connect to a MySQL database, and for simplicity, the code will be written in a single PHP file.
